**Status:**
DB Version has been completed The DAL implementation for XML based version has to be written from scratch.

Initial step to proceed with the project is to design the XML schema which will replace the Database....the idea behind using XML instead of DB exists because all systems does not have SQLServer or its free version as well.


For XML based data storage i am inclined towards usage of LINQ to XML classes and working in this direction.
